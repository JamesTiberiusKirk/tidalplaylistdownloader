# Tidal Playlist downloader

- Right this exacts artists from a cvs playlist
- Using a modified version of [tidal-dl](https://github.com/JamesTiberiusKirk/Tidal-Media-Downloader),
downloads the entire  discography using the artist's name

## TODO: 
- Propper re-writte, its very badly written right now
  - Propper parsing of args
- Add file logging to file
- Beets integration to automatically run it when done with downloading
- Create docker image with the forked version of tidal-dl
